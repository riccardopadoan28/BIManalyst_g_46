# Your learning experience for the concept you focused on

## Identify your own level at the beginning of this course and where you ended
- Riccardo: BIM Manager -> OpenBIM Champion
- Borja: Modeler -> Self Learner
- Ali: Modeler -> Self Learner

## What else do you still need to learn?
- Riccardo: More programming skills
- Borja: Continue diving into python programming
- Ali: Continue diving into python programming

## How you might use OpenBIM in the future?
- Riccardo: As a PM/consultant or software developer, but it is strictly linked to the industry and the company I will work with.
- Borja: I would be likely to use it as a PM/consultant
- Ali: 

# Your process of developing the tutorial

## Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?
- Riccardo: Sure, the topic I have chosen it's a little part of my MSc Thesis
- Borja: My focus is about construction processes. The course content will be useful in order to analyze projects before the contruction
- Ali:

## Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?
- Riccardo: No, but I would have preferred to be more coordinated along different managers/analysts.
- Borja: No, but I would have preferred to get a better guideline in the topics and development.
- Ali:

## Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we have more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?
- Riccardo: I think we used the necessary tools
- Borja: I think tools and contents are correct
- Ali:

 # (As a group) summary of the feedback you received on your tutorial did the tool address the use case you identified?

The use case we identified changed during the process. At the end of the day, we defined a structural cost estimation as the purpose of the tool, and we were still able to manage the changes and reach the goal.

## What stage does the tool you created work in Advanced Building Design? ( Stage A, B, C and/ or D).
This tool can be useful after the structural early design stage is completed and as well to assess cost estimation analysis during the design process. It needs a structural .ifc model to perform the calculation and it should be useful to PMs, BIM managers, BIM coordinators, quantity surveyors, cost controllers and to performe due diligence on the project. 

## Feedback 

| Group    | Feedback Points |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Group 42** | • Name-based matching requires manual verification to ensure reliability<br>• Excellent text outputs showing all data and results – suitable for final deliverables<br>• Very detailed with lots of information; great potential for final structural cost estimation<br>• Future improvement: generate text output with dimensions and type for ordering elements<br>• Great tool, very detailed and appears to work well |
| **Group 48** | • CSV price list could be more universal (not requiring a specific structure)<br>• Well-structured instructions on GitHub<br>• Dynamic quantity-to-price function with name matching is a really cool feature<br>• Good use of terminal checkpoints to track code progress during execution<br>• Large number of output files might overwhelm new users, but manageable with good documentation<br>• Shows promise as a price documentation tool for final design stages<br>• Huge potential in concrete manufacturing business; useful for salespeople calculating project prices |
| **Group 49** | • Nice file structure with clear distinction between folders and categories<br>• Good fallback handling for different units that could lead to errors<br>• Easy and simple code context for data extraction<br>• Nice overview for quantity take-off in data visualization<br>• Lots of potential for data use further along the AEC pipeline |


# (Individual) Your future for Advanced use of OpenBIM

## Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?
- Riccardo: I am currently using OpenBIM concept and IfcOpenShell documentation
- Borja: Currently, I am working on a company which is not commited to use any open tools
- Ali: I am not very likely to use OpenBIM tools in my thesis, mainly because I have not yet reached the thesis stage and my research focus is still uncertain. Now, I expect to rely more on other types of software, although I remain interested in the concepts behind OpenBIM

## Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years?
- Riccardo: I would be more than happy to use OpenBIM tools in the next years, and I hope the industry will commit more to this
- Borja: I would be likely to use it for individual projects or other companies
- Ali: I am not sure how likely it is that I will use OpenBIM tools in my professional life over the next 10 years. It will depend on the direction of my career and the software environment used in the companies or projects I work with.

# (Individual) Wrap up
## Conclude the journey through A1-A5
- Riccardo: Considering that my initial programming skills were basic, during the journey I faced lot of difficulties. The difference between the firsts and lasts assignments is huge, so I would have preferred to have more theoretical lectures, programming tutorials and explanations on how to use Git in the beginning of the course. At the end of the journey I can consider myself proud and happy of how I have improved my programming skills and my OpenBIM knowledge
- Borja: Coming from 0 coding skills, the content on the course webside was really helpfull. For the firsts assigments the content was sufficient but felt short for developing the tool. This meant that my other peer (Riccardo)had to take a leading rol, to assemble the tool together with our support. I finnish this course having a good understanding of coding and enough knowledge to contune the way as a self learner and to be able to implement the skills in the workplace or other projects
- Ali: During the A1–A5 journey, I started with only very basic programming skills and almost no experience with OpenBIM. The course resources helped me get started, but in assignments, Riccardo naturally took the lead while I focused on specific tasks and learning the workflow. By the end of the course, I feel I have built a solid basic understanding of coding, Git and OpenBIM, and I am confident enough to continue improving these skills and use them in future projects.
