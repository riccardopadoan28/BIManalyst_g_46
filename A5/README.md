# Your learning experience for the concept you focused on

## Identify your own level at the beginning of this course and where you ended
- Riccardo: BIM Manager -> OpenBIM Champion
- Borja: Modeler -> Self Learner
- Ali: Modeler -> Self Learner

## What else do you still need to learn?
- Riccardo: More programming skills
- Borja: Continue diving into python programming
- Ali:

## How you might use OpenBIM in the future?
- Riccardo: As a PM/consultant or software developer, but it is strictly linked to the industry and the company I will work with.
- Borja: I would be likely to use it as a PM/consultant
- Ali: 

# Your process of developing the tutorial

## Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?
- Riccardo: Sure, the topic I have chosen it's a little part of my MSc Thesis
- Borja: My focus is about construction processes. The course content will be useful in order to analyze projects before the contruction
- Ali:

## Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?
- Riccardo: No, but I would have preferred to be more coordinated along different managers/analysts.
- Borja: No, but I would have preferred to get a better guideline in the topics and development.
- Ali:

## Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we have more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?
- Riccardo: I think we used the necessary tools
- Borja: I think tools and contents are correct
- Ali:

 # (As a group) summary of the feedback you received on your tutorial did the tool address the use case you identified?

The use case we identified changed during the process. At the end of the day, we defined a structural cost estimation as the purpose of the tool, and we were still able to manage the changes and reach the goal.

## What stage does the tool you created work in Advanced Building Design? ( Stage A, B, C and/ or D).
This tool can be useful after the structural early design stage is completed and as well to assess cost estimation analysis during the design process. It needs a structural .ifc model to perform the calculation and it should be useful to PMs, BIM managers, BIM coordinators, quantity surveyors, cost controllers and to performe due diligence on the project. 

## Feedback 

<!-- Group 42:

Based on the name so one may have to match/check all elemts could be a lot of work. I do like it dosent have to be exact, but one would stil have to check trog to the data to be reliable.  

Some good txt outputs to show all the data and output, very nice that this could be a final hand in.  

Very detailed with lots of information, great potential for use for final cost of STR, or even work futher on it . 

Future is make a txt output with dimensions and type for ordering elemets.  

Great tool very detailed and seemes work trough  

 
Group 48: 

CSV price list file set-up: for future it might be nice to make it more universal, so the file doesn’t have to have a specific structure. 

Nicely structured instructions on the github. 

The dynamic quantity to price function (including the name matching) is a really cool feature. 

I like that there a checkpoints in the terminal, so you can see what the code is during while running. 

The amount of output files might be a bit overwhelming for new users, but this should be fine with good documentation (and since the target group is other engineering students).  

The tool shows promise as a price documentation tool for the final stages of design. 

Huge potential in the concrete manufacturing business. It would be super convenient with some tweaks for salespeople when calculating prices for a project. 

 
Group 49: 

Nice file structure with clear distinction between folders and categories.  

Good fallback and addressing the different units that could potentially leads to errors.  

Easy and simple code context for data extraction tool 

Nice overview for the quantity takeoff in data visualization.  

Lots of potential for data use further along the pipeline of AEC -->

# (Individual) Your future for Advanced use of OpenBIM

## Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?
- Riccardo: I am using OpenBIM principles and IfcOpenShell documentation
- Borja: Currently, I'm working on a company which is not commited to used any open tools.
- Ali:

## Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years?
- Riccardo: I would be more than happy to use OpenBIM tools in the next years, and I hope the industry will commit more to this
- Borja: I would be likely to use it for individual projects or other companies
- Ali:

# (Individual) Wrap up
## Conclude the journey through A1-A5
- Riccardo: Considering that my initial programming skills were basic, during the journey I faced lot of difficulties. The difference between the firsts and lasts assignments is huge, so I would have preferred to have more theoretical lectures and programming tutorials in the beginning of the course. At the end of the journey I can consider myself proud and happy of how I have improved my programming skills and my OpenBIM knowledge.
- Borja: Coming from 0 coding skills, the content on the course webside was really helpfull. For the firsts assigments the content was sufficient but felt short for developing the tool. This meant that my other peer (Riccardo)had to take a leading rol, to assemble the tool together with our support. I finnish this course having a good understanding of coding and enough knowledge to contune the way as a self learner and to be able to implement the skills in the workplace or other projects.
